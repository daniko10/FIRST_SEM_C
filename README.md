# PROJECT_C
My first journey with C on Computer Science studies *__*

I study Computer Science in Poland, AGH school. This project contains 3 different programs. In the first one, called "GITHUB", you will be able to 
choose one of 14 others programs (just built in one), the second and also the third one is made to put in some arguments. 
I hope you enjoy it :)
